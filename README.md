## World_Weather_Analysis

### Overview

This project utilizes API tools for OpenWeather and Google Maps to extract information on cities around the world. Information extracted include city name, country code, latitude and longitude, maximum temperature and current weather description. Using the Google Maps API, we were able to pull lodging availabilities for each city in our search criteria.

Ultimately, users can use this tool to create the basis of a vacation trip, as it provides directions mapping from Google Maps and it allows users to enter their desired temperature range for their dream vacation.
